## Introduction

SmoothCSV is a cross-platform CSV editor built for real work.
Edit your files intuitively, exactly how you want.
Lightning-fast performance, handles messy data, and powerful features like SQL queries.
Just smooth CSV editing that works.

*My aspiration is for this app to eventually be considered the "VS Code of tabular editors."*
